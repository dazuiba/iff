MultilngualFerretTools
======================

This plugin provides a multilingual-aware Analyzer for Ferret.  This analyzer is useful when 
fields may contain characters from multiple languages.  Fields are broken into latin parts and 
non-latin-parts- the latin parts are then processed with Ferret::Analysis::StandardAnalyzer, and 
the non-latin parts are processed with Ferret::Analysis::RegExpAnalyzer.  By default, the RegExpAnalyzer 
used considers each character as a distinct token.

If you want to change the configuration of the delegated analyzers, you'll find that initialization 
code in MultilingualFerretTools::Analyzer#token_stream_for.

Example Usage
=============

class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_ferret(
    { :fields => { blah blah blah },
    { :analyzer => MultilingualFerretTools::Analyzer.new }
  )
end
